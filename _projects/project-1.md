title: "Frontier Center for Accelerated Application Readiness (CAAR)"
excerpt: "To study the behavior of physical processes within rock structures, specifically to model multiphase flow processes, James McClure and his team have to first understand heterogeneous wettability. Wettability refers to the surface energy between fluids and solids and can vary due to the roughness and mineral composition of the material. McClureâ€™s team can use LBPM to read the volumetric maps of mineral composition and assign local wetting properties accordingly. With Frontier, they hope to train neural networks to predict the future geometric configuration of fluids.
