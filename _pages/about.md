I am a Research Associate Professor with the Virginia Tech National Security Institute. My research interests include non-equilibrium thermodynamics, parallel and distributed computing, and software co-design for emerging architectures. I am the main developer for the LBPM software package, which relies on lattice Boltzmann methods to simulate a wide range of transport phenomena. 


 * Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics
 * Lattice Boltzmann methods
 * Geometry and topology of complex structures
 * Software co-design
 * Applications for future computing arcitectures
