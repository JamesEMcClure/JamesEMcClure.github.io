I am the main developer for the [LBPM](https://lbpm-sim.org/) software package, which relies on lattice Boltzmann methods to simulate a wide range of transport phenomena. Current capabilities include simulation of fluid flows through porous materials, immiscibile flow, electrochemical systems and ion transport through biological membranes. LBPM has been extensively optimized for US exascale supercomputers, and is among the most efficient scientific computing applications in the world. My research interests include:

 * Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics
 * Lattice Boltzmann methods
 * Artificial intelligence & machine learning
 * Geometry and topology of heterogeneous materials
 * Biological transport phenomena 
 * Data reduction systems 
 * Software co-design
 * Applications for future computing arcitectures
