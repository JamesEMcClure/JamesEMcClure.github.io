I am a Research Associate Professor with the Virginia Tech National Security Institute. I have a Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences & Engineeringfrom the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am the main developer for the [LBPM](https://lbpm-sim.org/) software package, which relies on lattice Boltzmann methods to simulate a wide range of transport phenomena. Current capabilities include fluid flows through porous materials, immiscibile flow and electrochemical transport. LBPM has been extensively optimized for the world's largest supercomputers, and is among the most efficient scientific computing applications that exist.
