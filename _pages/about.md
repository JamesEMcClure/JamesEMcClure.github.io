I am a Research Associate Professor with the Virginia Tech National Security Institute. I have a Ph.D. in Environmental Sciences & Engineering from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I am the main developer for the [LBPM](https://lbpm-sim.org/) software package, which relies on lattice Boltzmann methods to simulate a wide range of transport phenomena. Current capabilities include fluid flows through complex micro-structures, immiscibile flow and electrochemical transport. 

 * Non-Equilibrium Thermodynamics
 * Lattice Boltzmann methods
 * Geometry and topology of heterogeneous structures
 * Transport phenomena
 * Software co-design
 * Applications for future computing arcitectures
